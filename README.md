# crypterminal
A terminal program that polls crypto-currency exchanges to show your portfolio value updated at all times.
Totally safe for use as no information regarding your portfolio ever leaves your computer and it only fetches the currency quotes from the exchanges.

Still in early development and will start supporting only Bitfinex Exchange.
